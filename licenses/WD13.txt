Description             : I just wanted all doomers to play Orginal Doom
			  one more time. All maps are similar in 
			  design and difficulty to their originals, but 
			  they are build from scratch.
			  I know, they simply look like originals, but 
			  they are still better than just modified ID`s 
			  levels..

V.1.3 change log	: see WD13ChLog.txt
