# RTFM #

So you got an AND!XOR DEF CON 32 HackBoi badge? Here's what you should know...

## TLDR ##

1. It plays DooM (poorly)
2. It has a few remaining challenges 
3. Do NOT put AA batteries in this, it uses 14500 Li-Ion rechargable batteries (button top). You shouldnt have to replace them unless you get drunk and lose them.

# 5n4ck3y (aka Snackey) Contest #

The newest member of AND!XOR, fully responsible for handing out free badges. Intern 4 life. Look for them in the conference... 

If your summercamp-fam are jealous and want to earn a free badge through hacking challenges, go see 5n4ck3y in the DEF CON Contest Area.

Let's explain 5n4ck3y, the challenge, and how this all pulls together. 
* 5n4ck3y (aka Snackey) is the vending machine dispensing badges
* The challenge scoreboard for both 5n4ck3y & HackBoi are hosted on the CTFd 5n4ck3y Challenge site (see links below). Yes, you hack on challenges to earn a badge and it continues once you have a badge in your possession. It's a cumulative scoreboard.

The general process one will follow:

1. Register at 5n4ck3y Challenge with a REAL e-mail address.
2. The first challenge is IRL physical verification with 5n4ck3y (look at the screen), this will unlock badge dispensing challenges in CTFd.
3. Solve five and earn a badge.

Instructions for physical verification(s) are on the specific challenge group of the CTFd site.

# Troubleshooting #
If you are having issues with the badge for any reason, try the #dc32 channel of our Discord. You could also swing by the contest area.

Given the structure of our discord channels, this is what is meant for what:

Channel -> Subchannel
* 5n4ck3y -> General banter and Q&A about 5n4ck3y
* Badge & CTF -> DC32 :: General collaborative non-spoiler discussion for people working on badge challenges and if there are any issues try crowdsourcing troubleshooting here if we cant get to you right away.
